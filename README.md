# question A
# By using nm, I found these 2 lines associated with the functions.
# 00000000004052d T _Z7averageif
# 0000000000404ed T _Z7averagePdRd
# The first one is for function "int average(int n1, float n2)". "_Z7averageif" mean that the function name is average with length 7, and its parameters are of type integer and float.
# The second one is for function "double average(double * n1, double & n2)", and the symbols "_Z7averagePdRd" mean that the function name is average with length 7, and its parameters is of type Pointer to Double, and Reference to Double.
